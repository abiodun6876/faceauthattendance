# FaceAuthAttendance - Project Documentation

## Project Overview
FaceAuthAttendance is a state-of-the-art, multi-tenant biometric attendance and organization management system. It leverages AI-powered face recognition to provide secure, contactless, and efficient tracking for staff, students, and visitors.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **UI Framework**: Ant Design (AntD)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Backend/Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with Realtime capabilities)
- **AI/Biometrics**: Face-api.js (TensorFlow.js based)
- **Date Handling**: Day.js
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS + Design Tokens

## Key Features

### 1. Biometric Enrollment
- High-precision face capture using system cameras.
- Real-time face detection and match quality assessment.
- Secure storage of 128D face embeddings (vectors) in Supabase.
- Mobile-responsive multi-step enrollment process.

### 2. Attendance System
- **Biometric Mode**: Automatic verification via face recognition (clock-in/clock-out).
- **Manual Mode**: Fallback ID-based entry for cases where biometry isn't available.
- **Multi-Tenant Scoping**: Data is strictly filtered by Organization and Branch/Device.
- **Shift Support**: Configurable work hours and late-arrival penalties.

### 3. Management Modules
- **User Management**: Unified interface for managing both Staff and Students.
- **Visitor Management**: Appointment scheduling, host notification, and unique pass code generation.
- **Leave Management**: Employee leave request submission and approval workflow.
- **Customer Management**: CRM-lite module for managing corporate or individual clients.

### 4. Dashboard & Analytics
- Real-time stats for "Present", "Late", "Absent", and total headcount.
- Clickable stats for quick drill-down into detailed reports.
- Organization-wide activity monitoring.

### 5. Multi-Tenant Architecture
- Supports multiple organizations (Schools, Offices, etc.).
- Subdomain-based organization identification.
- Branch-level data isolation within the same organization.

## Database Schema (Supabase)
Key tables include:
- `organizations`: Primary tenant data and global settings.
- `branches`: Physical locations under an organization.
- `users`: Unified table for staff and students.
- `attendance`: Attendance logs with confidence scores and photo proof.
- `face_enrollments`: Secure biometric data storage.
- `appointments`: Visitor scheduling data.
- `leave_requests`: Employee absence management.
- `devices`: Kiosk/Terminal registration data.

## Deployment & Build
- **CI/CD**: Netlify (Build command: `npm run build`).
- **ESLint**: Strict quality checks (Warnings treated as errors to ensure clean production builds).

## Security
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Enforced at the Supabase level to ensure users only see data belonging to their organization.
- **Biometric Security**: Face embeddings are stored as high-dimensional vectors, not raw biometric images, enhancing privacy.
